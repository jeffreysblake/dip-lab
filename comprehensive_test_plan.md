# Comprehensive Test Plan for DIP_Electron Application

## Overview

This document outlines a complete test coverage strategy for all core classes in the DIP_Electron application. Currently, only one class has test coverage (Spatial.ts), while five other core classes are missing tests:

1. dipCanvas.ts
2. dipImage.ts  
3. Frequency.ts
4. ImageData.ts
5. Projection.ts

## Test Strategy

All new test files will follow the same pattern as `Spatial.test.ts`:
- Use Jest framework with TypeScript support
- Follow BDD (Behavior Driven Development) style testing
- Include unit tests for all methods and properties
- Add integration tests for class interactions  
- Include edge case and error handling tests
- Maintain consistent naming conventions

## Individual Class Test Plans

- Constructor with width/height parameters
- image getter property 
- setPixel method (with RGBA values)
- getPixel method (returns RGBA array)  
- clear method (resets canvas to black)
- getImageData method

#### Test Coverage Areas:
- Basic instantiation and property access
- Pixel manipulation operations
- Canvas clearing functionality
- Data retrieval methods
- Edge cases with invalid coordinates
- Error handling for boundary conditions

- Constructor with width/height parameters
- get data property  
- get width property
- get height property
- setPixel method (with RGBA values)

#### Test Coverage Areas:
- Basic instantiation and property access
- Pixel manipulation operations

### 5. Projection.ts Tests

**File:** `src/main/classes/tests/Projection.test.ts`

#### Key Methods to Test:
- applyHorizontalProjection static method (horizontal projection)
- applyVerticalProjection static method (vertical projection)  
- applyRadialProjection static method (radial projection)
- applyAngularProjection static method (angular projection)
- applyCustomProjection static method (custom projection types)
- applyMultipleProjections static method (all projections)

#### Test Coverage Areas:
- Projection algorithms implementation
- Different projection types (horizontal, vertical, radial, angular)  
- Custom projection handling
- Multiple projection operations
- Edge cases with different image dimensions
- Error conditions and boundary checks

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Test File Structure Pattern
All test files will follow this structure:
```typescript
import { ClassName } from '../ClassName';

describe('ClassName', () => {
  describe('Constructor', () => {
    // Constructor tests
  });

  describe('Properties', () => {
    // Property getter tests  
  });

  describe('Methods', () => {
    // Method-specific tests
  });
});
```

### 2. Test Coverage Requirements

#### Unit Tests:
- All public methods should be tested with valid inputs
- Boundary conditions and edge cases must be covered
- Error handling for invalid parameters or boundary violations
- Return value verification (types, values)

#### Integration Tests:
- Class interaction scenarios  
- Multi-method operation sequences
- Data flow between components

#### Edge Case Tests:
- Empty/zero parameter values
- Invalid coordinate ranges
- Boundary condition checks
- Performance considerations with large images

### 3. Test Execution Strategy

1. **Initial Setup**: Create test files in `src/main/classes/tests/` directory
2. **Test Implementation**: Implement tests following existing patterns  
3. **Validation**: Run all tests to ensure they pass and cover requirements
4. **Documentation**: Update this document with any changes or additions

## Test Coverage Metrics

### Target Goals:
- 100% line coverage for each class (excluding comments)
- 95% branch coverage where applicable
- Comprehensive error handling test cases  
- Integration testing of class interactions

### Success Criteria:
- All new tests pass without failures
- No existing functionality is broken
- Test suite runs efficiently with minimal runtime overhead
- Clear, maintainable test code structure

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Create dipCanvas.ts tests (2 days)
2. **Week 1**: Create dipImage.ts tests (2 days)  
3. **Week 2**: Create Frequency.ts tests (2 days)
4. **Week 2**: Create ImageData.ts tests (2 days)
5. **Week 2**: Create Projection.ts tests (2 days)

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues:
- Complex mathematical operations in frequency domain processing
- Boundary condition handling for image data  
- Performance considerations with large images
- Integration issues between different classes

### Solutions:
- Implement comprehensive edge case testing
- Use existing test patterns as reference
- Add performance benchmarks where needed
- Validate integration scenarios thoroughly

## Conclusion

This comprehensive test plan ensures complete coverage of all core classes in the DIP_Electron application. By implementing these tests, we will significantly improve code quality, maintainability, and reduce potential bugs through thorough testing practices.
